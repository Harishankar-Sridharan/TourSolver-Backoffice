## 3. Understanding Depot Details

When you create a new Depot, you will fill out details across three main sections: General, Planning, and Quantity. Each section controls a different aspect of how the Depot functions within your scheduling and resource planning.

### A. General Section

This section handles the basic identification and core rules for your Depot.

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Field/Constraint</td><td valign="top">Purpose/Benefit</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Name</td><td valign="top">Identifying label for the Depot.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Address</td><td valign="top">Physical location of the Depot.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Constraints</td><td valign="top">Rules that govern how the Depot operates, such as Assign Resources, Explore Resources, or Availability.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### B. Planning Section

This section defines when the Depot is operational.

* You can specify the opening days.
* You can set the opening time.
* You can set the specific start and end time.
* You have the option to edit multiple opening days from this location.

### C. Quantity Section

This section defines the capacity and inventory available at the location.

* You will edit the initial quantity.
* You can define the available space.

You can easily manage multiple Depot entries at once using the import and export functions.

1. On the main Depot management screen, click the **Actions** menu.
2. Click on **Export** to download the file.
