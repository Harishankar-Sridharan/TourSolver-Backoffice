# How do I Geolocate my Delivery People

## Introduction

Being able to locate your delivery team in real-time is crucial for effective resource management. This guide simplifies the process of enabling the necessary access and configuring the mobile application settings so you can easily track your delivery people.

**Goal**: To successfully track the geolocation of your delivery people using the system.

## Getting Started

Before starting, the system assumes that you have already set up the delivery people and their planned routes. If these steps are not complete, you must first create the delivery, the delivery people, and the route.

### System Requirements (Access Configuration)

To ensure successful tracking, your delivery personnel must have the correct permissions and access enabled for both the web platform and the mobile application.

**Prerequisite Action**

| Access Type                 | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deliverer & Route Setup** | The delivery person and their assigned route must already be created. |
| **Web Access**              | Necessary for system login.                                           |
| **Mobile Access**           | Required for using the mobile app, which facilitates tracking.        |

## Feature Explanations and Benefits

The system offers key features that help you manage security, permissions, and tracking visibility:

* **Roles and Rights Management**: This is where you grant your delivery people the necessary permissions to operate within the system.
* **Mobile App Configuration**: This section allows you to fine-tune how the mobile app communicates with the system, including synchronization speed and agenda visibility.
* **Privacy Settings**(**GDPR Compliance**): You have the power to limit when tracking occurs, adhering to data privacy rules. This builds trust and ensures legal compliance by restricting geolocation tracking to only working hours and days.

## Enabling Geolocation Tracking

This process requires four main steps: navigating to the Optimization area, granting access, configuring permissions, and setting up the tracking view.

### Enabling Web and Mobile Access

This step ensures your delivery person can log into both the main system and the mobile application.

## Productivity Tips

Here are a few tips to maximize your use of the tracking feature:

* **Customize Your View**: Use the settings menu in the Fulfillment tab to modify what you see on the screen. If you only need location tracking, make sure the **map** and **agenda** displays are enabled.
* **Monitor Travel Time**: Ensure you review the mobile app configuration to **show travel time info**. This helps you accurately predict arrival times and manage expectations.
* **Keep Synchronization Frequent**: If real-time tracking is critical, check the **automatic synchronization frequency** setting in the mobile app configuration. A higher frequency provides more immediate location updates.
