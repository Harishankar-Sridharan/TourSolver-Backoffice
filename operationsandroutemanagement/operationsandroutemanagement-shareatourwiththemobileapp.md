# Share a Tour with the Mobile App

## 1. Introduction

This guide walks you through the process of exporting a planned route ("tool" or "tour") from the desktop system directly to the mobile application used by your field team. This process ensures mobile users receive an email or SMS notification containing the shared tour and its associated deliveries.

## 2. Getting Started Section

To successfully share a tour, you must first access the optimization section and select a completed route.

| **Trial Version**      | SMS notification   | Link to download the mobile application                                     |
| **Subscribed Version** | Notification Email | Notification to all selected mobile app users that the tour has been shared |

### Understanding Notifications

When you share the tour, the system handles notification delivery based on your account status:

## 3. Feature Explanations with Benefits

The **Share with the Mobile App** feature is crucial for connecting your planning efforts with real-world execution.

* **Seamless Route Transfer:** Easily transfer complex, optimized routes (tours) directly to the mobile device where they are needed.
* **Date-Specific Sharing:** You can control the exact date range for which the tour is active and accessible on the mobile app. Sharing a tour for a specific date range (e.g., 1 day duration) confirms exactly which deliveries should be performed on the selected date(s).
* **Confirmation Feedback:** The system provides clear feedback regarding how many deliveries are being shared and how many notifications are being sent to mobile users.
