# Export my Routes

### 1. Introduction

This guide will teach you how to select, customize, and export your completed routes using the route management system. Whether you need to share results with a team member via Excel or integrate data into a calendar, this process is designed to be straightforward and effective.

**Customizing Your Excel Export Settings**

When you choose to export to Excel, the system provides several options to tailor the resulting file.

1.  **Select Your Sheet Layout:** Choose how the route data is organized:

    * **One sheet for all deliverers**.
    * **One sheet per deliverer**.
    * _**Context**:_ This helps you decide if you want a consolidated view or detailed reports for individual team members.

💡 **Tip:** These configurations only apply to the Excel export option. Other formats (like PowerPoint or Calendar) will use their standard output settings.

2. **Selecting Custom Fields (Columns)**

You can choose which specific columns (fields) appear in your exported file.

1. Click on **other** within the configuration window.
2. You will see a list of **available fields** and **display fields**.

### 5. Productivity Tips

Here are some ways to make the route exporting process more efficient:

* **Customize Columns for Efficiency (Filtering Data):** If you only need two or three specific data points for a quick analysis, use the **other** option in the configuration menu to remove unnecessary fields. This keeps your report clean and focused, ensuring the export file contains only **standard and mapped columns** that matter most.
* **Use Calendar Export for Scheduling:** Instead of exporting complex data, use the **export to calendar** option (Office Outlook or Google) to quickly give deliverers their finalized shift timings and route appointments, simplifying daily logistics.
* **Save Configuration Time:** Once you have set up your desired sheet layout and field selections (like generating **one sheet per deliverer** or including **shift timings**), click **Save**. This allows you to quickly execute the export in the future without re-selecting all the detailed configurations.
