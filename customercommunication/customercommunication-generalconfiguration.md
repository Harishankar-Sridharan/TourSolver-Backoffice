### 3. Feature Explanations and Benefits

This configuration area manages two powerful ways you can reach your customers:

| Feature                             | Description & Usefulness                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Outgoing Email Service** | Enables the system to send emails to customers on your behalf. **Benefit:** You can customize the look of your emails using branding elements like your header and footer images. |
| **Customer Outgoing SMS Service**   | Enables the system to send text messages (SMS) directly to customers. **Benefit:** Provides fast, direct communication for urgent or important updates.                           |

**Key Considerations for SMS:**

* ⚠️ **Warning: Paid Service** – Enabling the outgoing SMS service is a **paid service**. You will be charged based on the volume of SMS messages sent to your customers.
* **Character Limit** – Each standard SMS message must be **160 characters**. If your message exceeds 160 characters, the system will automatically **split the SMS into two SMS messages**.

4. **Add Footer Image Link (Optional):** Enter the **footer image link**. This often contains legal information or contact details. 💡 **Tip:** If you do not enter a header image link and a footer image link, the resulting email will be sent without these visual elements.

#### Task 2: Enabling Outgoing SMS

1. **Enable SMS Service:** Locate and enable the **customer outgoing SMS service**.
   * **Context:** If you enable this service, your customers will begin receiving SMS messages from the system.

### 5. Productivity Tips

Here are a few tips to maximize your effectiveness when using the General Configuration settings:

* 💡 **Consistent Branding:** Always try to enter both the **header image link** and the **footer image link**. Using these links helps maintain professional branding for all emails sent to your customers.
* ⚠️ **Watch Your Character Count:** When sending SMS messages, remember the **160 character limit**. Keep your messages concise to avoid having them split into two separate, chargeable messages.
* 💡 **Immediate Validation:** To ensure seamless email delivery, complete the validation step immediately after clicking **save**. The validation link confirms that the system (referred to as Cruisers/Crew Solver) has permission to send messages using your chosen sender address.
