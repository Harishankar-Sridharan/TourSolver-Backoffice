## 1. Introduction

The **End of Visit** communication setting allows you to automate follow-up messages sent to your customer.

**What is the End of Visit?**
It is the process that occurs **once the delivery has been completed**. Upon completion, the customer automatically receives an email with an attached PDF file.

**The PDF Proof of Delivery (PoD)**
This attached PDF serves as the official proof of delivery. It confirms essential details for the customer, including:
*   The customer’s name
*   The customer’s address
*   Signatures collected during the visit

## 5. Productivity Tips

Use these tips to maximize the effectiveness and clarity of your customer communications.

*   **💡 Pre-Check the PoD Content:** Remember that the PDF attachment is crucial. You can remind yourself that the customer will verify their name, address, and signatures within the attachment.
*   **💡 Use the Preview Often:** Before saving any changes, use the preview feature to double-check formatting and ensure the message body reads correctly. The preview shows exactly what the customer will see.
