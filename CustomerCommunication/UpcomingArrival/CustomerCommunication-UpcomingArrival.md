## 5. Productivity Tips

Here are a few ways to maximize the effectiveness of your upcoming arrival communications:

*   💡 **Dual Channel Communication:** Consider enabling **both** outgoing emails and outgoing SMS. Using both methods ensures the customer receives the critical ETA information regardless of whether they check their inbox or their text messages first.
*   💡 **Always Preview:** Use the option to **see the preview of the email** before saving configuration changes. This is your chance to verify the message contains the link of the live location as expected.
*   ⚠️ **Understanding Trigger Points:** Remember that the ETA link is sent *once the deliverer completes the delivery* phase (meaning, they are on their way to the customer). Ensure your operational definitions of "completes the delivery" align with when you want the customer to start tracking the live location.

This feature acts like a **GPS for peace of mind**. Just as a weather app tells you when the rain will start and allows you to track the storm's movement, the Upcoming Arrival feature tells your customers their expected delivery time and lets them watch the actual progress of their delivery vehicle in real-time.
