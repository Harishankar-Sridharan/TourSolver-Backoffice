## 5. Productivity Tips

Here are a few tips to maximize the efficiency of the Next Visits communication feature:

1.  **Leverage the Trigger Action:** Remember that the message is **only sent** once you successfully enter the option **delivered** for the customer you are currently serving. This delivery status acts as the trigger for the system to notify the upcoming customers.

2.  **Maximize Customization:** Always use the dollar symbol ($) when editing the message body. This ensures you utilize available fields for dynamic content, creating professional and detailed communication without manual entry every time.

3.  **Keep Message Count Low:** While you can notify two or three customers at once, consider the length of time between visits. Notifying only the **next customer** (by entering **1**) ensures the arrival estimate is as accurate as possible.
