# Comprehensive User Guide: Customer Communication - Visit Cancellation

This guide provides simple, step-by-step instructions for managing visit cancellations and ensuring clear communication with your customers, helping you reschedule deliveries easily and efficiently.

***

## 1. Introduction

The Visit Cancellation feature is essential when a **customer is not available while you are delivering a product**. Instead of marking the item as permanently delivered, this process allows you to quickly change the status and provide the customer with the option to **reschedule the delivery**.

When you activate a visit cancellation, the system automatically sends an email to the customer containing the reason for the cancellation and a direct link for them to reschedule.

## 2. Getting Started Section

### System Requirements and Setup

The sources available do not specify technical system requirements or installation steps for this feature. We assume the system is already installed and accessible. This section focuses on the required initial configuration within the Visit Cancellation screen.

### Initial Configuration: Enabling Communications

Before processing a cancellation, you must ensure that communication channels are active so the customer receives the rescheduling link.

1.  **Access the Cancellation Settings:** Click the **visit cancellation** option.

    *   **Outgoing emails**

## 5. Productivity Tips

*   **Always Enable Both:** For maximum customer reach, ensure you **enable the outgoing emails and the outgoing SMS** when setting up the cancellation. This provides redundancy in case the customer misses one communication method.
*   **Use the Preview Feature:** Before clicking **save**, always utilize the feature to **see the preview of the email**. This confirms the cancellation reason and rescheduling link are displayed correctly, preventing communication errors.
*   **Track Rescheduled Items:** Regularly check the **fulfillment tab** under **to be rescheduled**. This ensures no canceled visits are missed and keeps your logistics workflow current.
