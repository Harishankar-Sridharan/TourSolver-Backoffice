### 5. Productivity Tips

These tips will help you work more efficiently and ensure smooth communication with your customers:

*   **Use the Preview Feature:** Always use the message **preview** option available for both outgoing emails and outgoing SMS. This helps you confirm exactly what the customer will see before you save your settings, ensuring accuracy and clarity.
*   **Keep Durations Clear:** When setting the **Communicated Time Window Duration**, choose common increments (like 60 minutes or 120 minutes) that are easy for customers to understand. A clear, defined window prevents confusion.
*   **Saving is Key:** Remember that none of your settings will take effect until you click the **Save** button after entering all the details. Make saving the final mandatory step in your process.
